# This crontab works on both macOS and Linux
#
# Alternatively set up systemd timers:

#
# Vixie Cron does not support expanding env vars, so stuffing in `$HOME/bin` does not work
#   It does support the bash-ism of tilde expansion, so having ~/bin in the PATH will work
#   Unfortunately, tilde expansion is a shell thing and using stuff like Node's child_process.exec 
#   will NOT expand that, so you have to use stuff like `untildify` to expand the full path
#   A fork of cronwrap3 that handles this is available at github.com/fatso83/cronwrap3
